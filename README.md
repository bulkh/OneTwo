# OneTwo
muOS theme based on Rezolution by Rosabel

### Supported resolutions:
- 640x480
- 720x480
- 720x720
- 1280x720*

*I made 1280x720 resolution to look nice on HDMI output, so on TrimUI Smart Pro scaling will look too tiny. Will add support for it later, when it will be officialy supported by muOS.

### Color schemes:
- Dark
- Light
- DMG
- SNES
- GC
- BMO (only with face)
- Mustard (only standard)
## Installation

1. Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/bulkh/OneTwo/releases) page
2. Find the most recent release
3. Download the muxthm file with the variant you want
4. Move it to `/MUOS/theme/` (on the `SD2`, or `SD1` if you use only one card)
5. Apply the theme from the **Theme Picker**
> [!TIP]
> For best look you should set Overlay Transparency (in Interface Options) to 255, or you can turn it off by setting to 0
